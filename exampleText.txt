AS OUR SHIP materialised gracefully into the panorama of Bridgetown, Barbados,
things were beginning to settle into some sort of cohesive pattern.
I was getting a rough idea of how the ship ran, I had caught up on my sleep,
and the Windy brain was back in control of the world.
The names and routines of the lads around me were taking shape,
all the deep-tanks we had cleaned were safely full of cargo,
and I was beginning to feel a lot happier with life.
